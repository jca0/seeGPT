analyze your AI usage by seeing what you use AI for the most and how you use AI over time  
currently have:
- cluster conversations to see how you have used at a point in time

will have:
- see you many messages you send over time (day, week, month, year)
- see what kind of messages you send over time
- update online (eventually)
- hierarchical clusters

some concerns:  
- HDBSCAN classifies too many messsages as noise
